# NGO Databases

This microproject will seek to learn about databases used by leading humanitarian organizations, list their names and provide [Humanitarian AI](https://www.meetup.com/Humanitarian-AI/) members with an idea of what they're used for and what types of
fields they incorporate.

## Objectives

Information about NGO databases will help AI researchers and developers understand what information is vital to the humanitarian community and how that information is used, labeled and organized.
